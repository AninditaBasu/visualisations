-    Tweet word cloud. Reads data from a JSON file and uses amueller's wordcloud library. Data in the JSON file is from tweets of several people, pulled at random over several days. Tweets are cleaned up for hashtags, punctuations, user names, and other unnecessary strings before feeding into the wordcloud library.
-    Bar graph of Titanic survivors. Reads data from a CSV file and uses matplotlib's barchart module. The CSV file is from biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3.xls.
