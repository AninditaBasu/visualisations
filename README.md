-    Tweet word cloud. Reads data from a JSON file and uses [amueller's wordcloud library](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud). Data is in a JSON file, of tweets of several people pulled at random over several days. Tweets are cleaned up for hashtags, punctuations, user names, and other unnecessary strings before feeding into the `wordcloud` library. 
-    Bar graph of Titanic survivors. Reads data from a CSV file and uses pylab's [barchart](http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/barchart_demo.html) example. The CSV file is from biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3.xls.
